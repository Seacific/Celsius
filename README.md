**A simple engine written entirely in C**

Currently only draws a simple triangle. 

**TODO:**
Texture Mapping
Restructure graphics pipeline to be more flexible
Easy support for other objects on screen
Remove requirements of knowledge of dependencies
Rewriting Graphics Pipeline to render on the GPU.

(Maybe) Change to windows API to remove SDL dependency

Literally Everything Else Required in an Engine.

Will not continue on other parts of engine before graphics pipeline is done.
